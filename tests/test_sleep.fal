// The coroutine
// This will jump in concurrently to the main
// routine. As the first sleep is of 4.5 seconds,
// the first line will appare between the 4th and
// 5th line of the main routine.
function coro()
   > "Coroutine launched"
	sleep( 4.5 )
	> "Hello, this is a coroutine jumping in"
	sleep( 5.9 )
	> "Coroutine is done"
end

// main program

launch coro()
