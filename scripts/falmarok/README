                          Version 1.2


  This small script for XChat prints a "Now playing" notify on the
current channel when KDE music player Amarok changes the tune. It
has also a small set of commands that allow to turn it on or off,
print only locally without sending to the channel and print manually
the curren tune.

  Also, a set of simple utility commands to start, stop and skip
tunes are provided.
