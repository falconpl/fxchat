                        The XChat Falcon Plgugin

                           Version 0.9 series

  To compile this plugin for XChat2, you'll need XChat 2.x API and
Falcon 0.9 (Albatros), or following versions, that can be found at

     http://falconpl.org

  To install this plugin, just copy or link it in your xchat home directory
(generally ~/.xchat2), or follow the instructions for XChat2 plugin
installation that can be found at http://www.xchat.org

  Once installed, the "/falcon" command will be added to the availble
user commands, and the File menu/load option will recognize scripts with the
".fal" extension as Falcon scripts. Use the command "/falcon help" for
detailed technical help on the plugin.

  The directory /tests contains some example (the most complete of which is
"parrot.fal"). The tests are commented and provide a minimal guide through
initial script development.

   Complete documentation for the plugin API can be found at
